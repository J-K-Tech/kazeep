# kzip alpha 0-0 0.0 0_0
the ultimate compression algorithm
that can make anything down to 16 bytes
if u got patience to compress it enough ofc

please just use this thing files
for now there is no support for folders
so you might want to zip the folder first (just store is enough, so you wont waste time)

-h or --help or empty or wrong to see this
-c to compress
-d to decompress
-o output file
-b size of target chunks in bits (standard: 2048), the higher the more compressed but slower to compress
example: kzip -c thicc -o thin.kz
other example: kzip -d thin.kz -o thicc
